üèóÔ∏è Milestone Project ‚Äì AWS EC2 + DokuWiki Deployment
This project demonstrates the deployment and configuration of a DokuWiki web application on an Apache web server running on an Ubuntu EC2 instance in AWS.
The wiki serves as a knowledge base containing AWS notes, Linux commands, and other learning resources.

The goal was to configure the environment automatically using a Bash User Data Script, so that the EC2 instance is fully functional on first boot.
